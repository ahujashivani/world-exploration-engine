# World-Exploration-Engine
 - Designed and built an interactive world exploration game with a graphical user interface similar to NES Game "Zelda II"
 - Created software that parsed keyboard presses and user input to allow the user to explore and interact with objects in the world
 - Implemented a caching system by saving information into files to save and load the game (using Java IO API)
 - Led a development cycle from ideation to presentation and managed the enormous complexity that comes with building a large system
